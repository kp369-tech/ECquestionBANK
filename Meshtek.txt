DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTION 

 

Problem statement:

 

Step 1 : Ask user to enter number from 1 to 10

Step 2 : If the number is even then minus 1 from it so the number will be an odd number every time.
  For Ex. if the input number is 8, consider n is equal to 7 And print the number of n as "Loop number is 7".
          If the input number is 5, consider n is equal to 5 And print the number of n as "Loop number is 5".

Step 3 : Draw the following pattern for the n line:

If the n is 7, the pattern would be something like the following:
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
   2 2 2 2 2
      3 3 3
         4
      5 5 5
   6 6 6 6 6
7 7 7 7 7 7 7

SAMPLES:
1.
Input: 5

Output:
Input number is 5
Loop number is 5

1 1 1 1 1
   2 2 2
      3
   4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5

2.
Input: 8

Output:
Input number is 8
Loop number is 7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
   2 2 2 2 2
      3 3 3
         4
      5 5 5
   6 6 6 6 6

7 7 7 7 7 7 7
